    desc: "I have worked with other web designers before but was never satisfied with the end result. From start to finish my interaction with the team at Elonatech was professional, stress-free and I had complete trust in their ability to deliver. Their difference is: They took the time to listen to what I wanted but also brought their own ideas, experience and creativity so that the end design was more rounded. They understood that I needed to see things in a visual context and have some flexibility to 'play' around with a few ideas. All of this was done face to face at their office making the process highly personal.",

Elonatech Nigeria Ltd.is a perfect solution for us because we have the same IT Professional with us every week who is very familiar with our network, and we don't have to worry about dealing with computer problems on our own anymore. The fact that Elonatech Nigeria Ltd uses Microsoft best practices is very important to us, too. We are confident that if someone else had to manage our network down the road, it would be easy to do because of the systems that are in place.”",

    desc: "The challenge we face is that we are big enough to need a network with specific functionality, but not necessarily requiring a full-time IT staff person. Elonatech Nigeria Ltd. provided the perfect solution; they have the technical expertise and mindshare we needed coupled with flexibility in the level of support. They are really responsive, prioritizing important issues that arise and dealing with them quickly and effectively. I also appreciate their detailed follow-up and preventive maintenance; more than once this has helped us avoid a major problem with our network. A lot of companies these days make claims about customer service and looking out for the best interest of their clients, but Elonatech can be trusted to do what they say—and for a competitive price.",
